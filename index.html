							<h2>Software Developer</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/senior_portrait.png" alt=""/></span>Hi, I am Alexander Kalams, but I go by Alex. I am a computer science major at the University of Michigan College of Engineering planning to minor in music. Here is a little bit about me.</p>


							<p>I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee and have lived there almost my entire life. I went to Montgomery Bell Academy for high school. Here, I competed on the debate team, where I went to University of Michigan for a debate camp. Seeing the campus made me fall in love with this school, leading me to later apply and enroll.</p>
								
								
							<p>When I was young, I dreamed about becoming a videogame designer one day and went to a summer camp that introduced me to some basic coding concepts for programming a video game. Here, I discovered that I have a passion for coding. I took a computer science class during high school and saw software development as a promising career for me, leading me to pursue computer science in college.</p>
								
								â€‹
								
							<p>I am also passionate about music. At first, I taught myself how to play guitar as a hobby during my junior year of high school. However, exploring the music classes offered at Michigan has made me want to take my interest in music more seriously. I am currently taking an introductory music theory course and plan to take more advanced classes in the future to complete a music minor.</p>
