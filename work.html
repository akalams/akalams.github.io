						<p>Schneider Electric is a multinational energy management company which creates many of the electronics that help power your home! During the summer of 2023, I began an internship at Schneider Electric which continued through the 2023-2024 school year.</p>

						<p>During this internship, I was tasked with creating an Augmented Reality App in Unity which would help manufacturing plant workers build electrical cabinets. One of the biggest challenges of this project was figuring out how to parse data and 3D models exported from CAD software at runtime so that work orders could be viewed in 3D. This required me to do extensive research on third party tools that would help with parsing json and interpreting 3D models. Eventually, I was able to successfully combine these tools to create a seamless experience that would display all the information a user would need at runtime as soon as they typed an order's name.</p>

						<p>This job also gave me experience on designing and implementing UI based on feedback. I often would meet with plant workers so I could learn about their process of working through an order. I would then use their feedback to help improve the UI of my app.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Soundskrit - <em>Intern</em></h1>
							<p>Soundskrit is a Canadian startup creating MEMS directional microphones. Over the summer of 2022, I worked in their Ann Arbor office developing software to improve the efficiency of their microphone testing. Using their automatic semiprobe, I learned how to interface with it using Python to test thousands of devices a day.</p>
                            <p>After testing, I would generate heatmaps using Python's Seaborn module to illustrate trends in measurements across wafers. I would then present findings from the data to the rest of the company at weekly meetings. This process taught me a lot about how to be an effective presenter. By the end of the internship, I became more thoughtful about how to present data to to others.</p>
