						<h1>Blog 1 (1/28-2/11) - The First Classic Sprint</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>The showcase is just around the corner! That means that the team has one last chance to fix bugs and add that last bit of polish. The first half of this 2 week cycle was also Thanksgiving, which was a great chance for us to unwind before this busy week!</p>
						<h2>Meetings (2 hours)</h2>
						<p>We had two, two hour meetings during this 2 week period. One QA check-in on the 29th and one wrap-up meeting on the 3rd.</p>

						<h2>Gunstar Heroes Study (1 hour)</h2>
						<p>A large portion of the QA process this week was running our own playtests to find bugs to squash. Since I was assigned to the AI, my playtesting sessions consisted of playing against the AI repeatedly. Throughout this process, I was able to locate a few bugs and then determine the proper steps to reproduce them.</p>
