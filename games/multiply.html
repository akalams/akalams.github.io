							<p>Tails of War, also known as Project Multiply, is a multiplayer turn-based tactics game that I helped develop over two semesters at Wolverine Soft Studio. The project was the studio's first attempt at making an online multiplayer game which presented some new challenges but was also super exciting to work on!</p>

							<p>During the Summer semester of this project my main job was to create the foundation for the matchmaking system. Using the Photon library for Unity, I created the basic room creation and joining system. I also allowed rooms to be password locked for private games.</p>

							<p>During the following Fall semester, I moved from working on the matchmaking to helping build the AI for the singleplayer mode. The AI used a weighting system where every action was given a score based on how effective the move would be. The AI would then select the highest scoring option. My job on the project was to create scoring algorithms for several possible enemy actions including each of the three commanders' special abilities. I also got to work with Unity's editor tool system to develop a helpful visualization tool for which tiles the AI would favor.</p>
