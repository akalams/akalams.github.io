						<h1 class="major">Pride Engine - EECS 498</h1>
						<p>The Pride Engine was a C++ engine I created for the Game Engine Architecture class, EECS 498, which supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. This project took me the whole semester to complete and required me to learn multiple third party libraries and how to integrate them!</p>

						<p>Rendering, input management, and audio were all handled using SDL 2. To provide customizability to the developers, the engine hosted Lua as a scripting language using LuaBridge and used Box2D for rigid body physics simulation.</p>

						<p>At the end of the course, we were required to design and implement our own custom feature which would make our engine stand out. I decided to import Dear Imgui and create an editor mode for my engine that would allow developers to quickly edit and save scenes. Watch a demo of the custom feature below!</p>

							<p>Ask485 is project my team and I worked on for my web development class. This project required us to build a search engine for a collection of Wikipedia articles using an inverted index and PageRank.</p>
                            <p>The project consisted the three parts. In the first part, we used a MapReduce framework to generate an inverted index for the collection of documents. We then created a Rest API to request and combine data from three inverted index servers storing the inverted index we computed in part one. Lastly, we made a Flask server which dynamically rendered pages to the user based on their query.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>Insta485 is a recreation of Instagram I made for my web development class with my project team. Using React, we created a client-side dynamic page which rendered a unique page based on who the user follows. We also implemented several interactive features such as like and comment buttons which worked without refreshing the page.</p>
							<p>For the back end, we designed a Rest API we made asynchronous requests to, allowing our frontend to access data from our SQL database. Lastly, we used server-side dynamic pages rendered with Flask to create pages for each user.</p>
